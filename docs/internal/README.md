# Internal System Documentation

This directory contains non-public documentation defining VERA’s
architectural invariants, control boundaries, and irreversible decisions.

These documents exist to:
- preserve system intent across contributors
- prevent accidental governance regressions
- support audit, diligence, and internal review

This is not product documentation.
This is not marketing material.
This is not user-facing.

Changes to behavior governed here require explicit architectural review.
