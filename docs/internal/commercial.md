# Commercial Model

This document defines the internal commercial posture for VERA.
It is not a marketing document and is not customer-facing.

The purpose of this document is to clarify what is sold, how it is sold,
and which constraints are non-negotiable in any commercial engagement.

---

## What Is Sold

VERA commercializes governance infrastructure for conversational AI.

The primary licensable assets are:

### Interaction Boundary Architecture (IBA)

A formal, enforceable interaction standard governing how AI systems
engage humans.

IBA defines boundaries around:
- tone and pacing
- user agency and exit language
- challenge and confrontation behavior
- non-coercive response structure

IBA is model-agnostic and UI-agnostic.
It is licensed as governance infrastructure, not as a model or prompt set.

---

### Signal Integrity Model (SIM)

A state-aware safety and pacing engine that evaluates conversational
strain and governs depth, abstraction, and response intensity.

SIM:
- operates deterministically at the system level
- is not a clinical model
- is not a diagnostic or therapeutic mechanism
- governs behavior without suppressing conversation

SIM is licensed as a control-plane component.

---

### VERA Reference Implementation

VERA itself serves as a reference implementation of IBA and SIM
in a production conversational system.

The reference implementation may be licensed or deployed as:
- a hosted product
- an embedded conversational layer
- a design-partner system

The reference implementation is not required for licensing IBA or SIM.

---

## How VERA Is Sold

VERA is sold primarily through B2B licensing and enterprise agreements.

Supported commercial structures include:

- Annual platform licenses
- Per-deployment or per-tenant licenses
- Enterprise support and customization agreements
- Design-partner engagements

Direct-to-consumer revenue is secondary and primarily serves
as validation and learning.

---

## Pricing Bands (Internal Guidance)

Pricing is determined by deployment scope, regulatory exposure,
and support requirements.

Indicative internal bands:

- Early platform license: low six figures annually
- Standard enterprise license: mid six figures annually
- High-risk or regulated deployments: high six figures to low seven figures

Support, customization, and ongoing governance consultation
are priced separately.

These bands are directional and may vary by deal.

---

## What Is Explicitly Not Sold

VERA does not sell:

- Foundation models
- Model weights or training data
- Clinical, medical, or therapeutic guarantees
- Outcome guarantees tied to user behavior
- Client-side enforcement-only solutions

VERA governance must remain server-side and enforceable.

---

## Deal Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

The following constraints apply to all commercial agreements:

- Governance enforcement may not be disabled or bypassed
- Consent architecture may not be removed
- Finalization as a single user-visible exit gate must be preserved
- SIM and IBA logic may not be reimplemented client-side
- Licensing may not imply clinical use or medical claims

VERA will not enter agreements that compromise these constraints.

---

## Positioning Guidance

VERA is positioned as infrastructure, not a feature.

It is sold on:
- risk reduction
- auditability
- deployability
- long-term trust

It is not s
