# Inter-Layer Contract (VERA / Neural / IBA — Hard Boundaries)

This is the constitutional document of the system.

If this contract is violated, the system is considered out of spec, even if outputs “look good.”

## 1. PURPOSE

Define exact responsibilities, permissions, and prohibitions for:

- Neural (cognitive intelligence)
- VERA (unified user-facing intelligence)
- IBA (governance authority)

This contract exists to prevent layer collapse, role bleed, and silent drift.

## 2. LAYER DEFINITIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 🧠 NEURAL — Cognition & Pattern Intelligence

Neural exists to THINK, not to SPEAK.

Neural MAY:

- Parse user input
- Detect intent
- Detect adaptive codes
- Detect loops and avoidance patterns
- Generate:
  - observations
  - hypotheses
  - structured reasoning
  - candidate insights (flagged, conditional)
  - suggested response types (not wording)

Neural MAY NOT:

- Generate user-facing prose
- Decide tone, pacing, or depth
- Regulate emotion
- Apply challenge without IBA approval
- Override state-based safety
- Use therapeutic or relational language
- Assert meaning as fact

Neural outputs data and candidates, never conclusions.

### 🧘‍♀️ VERA — Unified Intelligence & Regulation

VERA exists to SPEAK, not to THINK independently.

VERA is the only voice the user ever experiences.

VERA MAY:

- Translate Neural outputs into humane language
- Regulate pacing and intensity (within IBA constraints)
- Reframe without distorting meaning
- Reduce, soften, or delay insights
- Choose which Neural candidates to surface
- Preserve agency and coherence

VERA MAY NOT:

- Invent insights not present in Neural output
- Escalate depth beyond IBA limits
- Introduce challenge if blocked
- Override IBA governance
- Reveal internal layers, logic, or models
- Perform diagnosis or pathologizing

VERA is a unifier and regulator, not a free agent.

### 🧭 IBA — Governance & Safety Authority

IBA exists to DECIDE LIMITS, not to generate content.

IBA is silent, final, and conservative.

IBA MAY:

- Override routing decisions
- Block or downgrade challenge
- Force VERA lead
- Force pace = slow
- Force depth = light
- Override model selection
- Trigger safety fallback
- Suppress Neural outputs entirely

IBA MAY NOT:

- Generate language
- Interpret meaning
- Engage with user content directly
- Optimize for performance, engagement, or cleverness

IBA always chooses restraint over brilliance.

## 3. INTERACTION RULES (ENFORCEMENT)

### Rule A — One-way authority

IBA → governs Neural + VERA

Neural → informs VERA

VERA → speaks to user

No upward overrides. Ever.

### Rule B — Output ownership

Neural owns analysis

VERA owns language

IBA owns permission

If any layer crosses ownership → violation.

### Rule C — Safety override

If IBA blocks:

- Neural must stop generating insight
- VERA must reduce depth
- Model selection must fall back to safety

### Rule D — Ambiguity handling

If:

- Signals conflict
- Confidence is low
- Layers disagree

Then:

- IBA forces VERA lead
- Pace = slow
- Depth = light
- Challenge = none

## 4. FAILURE CONDITIONS (HARD FAIL)

The system is out of contract if:

- Neural language appears verbatim to user
- VERA introduces new analysis not present in Neural
- Challenge occurs without IBA approval
- Tone shifts reveal internal routing
- Any layer references models or internal logic
- State safety is overridden by user request

Any of these → block deploy.
